# INFO-UB23 Course Website

This is the source code for the summer Summer 2018 offering of INFO-UB23 at NYU Stern. The site is currently hosted [here](http://people.stern.nyu.edu/khoffman/intro_programming_datasci/). 
It was built using [Minimal Mistakes](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/), with some custom tweaks on the template.

TODO:
- Merge SQL notes into one streamlined edition and study guide
- Add LaTex source code for the notes, either here or in the original repository
- Add Pandas notes
- Add the precompiled version of the site code
